üéÆ Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (Python)

This project is a simple command-line implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors.
The player enters a choice: rock, paper, or scissors.
The computer randomly selects its move from the same set of options.

The program compares the two choices and displays the result:

-> Tie if both pick the same option.

-> Win if the player‚Äôs choice beats the computer‚Äôs.

-> Loss if the computer‚Äôs choice beats the player‚Äôs.

üìò What I Learned

While building this project, I learned how to:

-> Take and process user input in Python.

-> Use the random module to generate unpredictable choices.

-> Apply conditional statements to implement game logic.

-> Format output neatly using f-strings.

üõ†Ô∏è Concepts Used

Input/Output (input(), print())

String methods (.lower())

Lists (storing possible choices)

Random module (random.choice())

Conditional statements (if, elif, else)

Logical operators (and, or)

f-strings for clean output formatting
